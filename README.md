# Module10Challenge
The task is to create:
1. A Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods.
2. Plot the results to visually show the performance to the board.

# Technologies
- python 3.9.12
- JupyterLab
- libraries: pandas, hvplot, pathlib, sklearn
- MacOs

### Plotting the Results

<b>Question:</b> After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?</br>

<b>Answer:</b> The inertia values are lower, which indicates that we probably got rid of the unuseful information by applying PCA method - "lost the noise".
